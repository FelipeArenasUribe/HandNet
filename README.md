# HandNet: Bringing Deep Learning coser to people

This is a project I developed as an undergrad (Fall 2020) for my class: Introduction to Deep Leaning.

The overall idea was to develop a deep learning mdoel that could classify images from lettes in sign language using Transfer Learning on MobileNet as the base model and then refining its results with my own Dataset. 

From this model we could, in the future, develop an app that could assist people with dissabilities to communicate with more people. 

You can download the images from the dataset in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E_B8oRYL62rLQ2knXmaEu1LGxbVcMsnB?usp=drive_link). 

The trained Keras models can also be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LfVGq0mXRJG5xIUomvuXLSz_-AQ-7eQb?usp=drive_link).
